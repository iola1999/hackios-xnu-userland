/*
 * This copy serves the iOS 16.5 line; userland/build.sh builds it into root.apfs. The copy that
 * iOS 26 runs is hackios-xnu-kernel/tools/userland-driver/redwoodmetal.m: package.py builds it
 * (DRIVER_SOURCES) under the same install name, /redwood/lib/libredwoodmetal.dylib, so work on
 * iOS 26 belongs in the kernel repository.
 *
 * The device object of a Metal driver for this port, as a real library.
 *
 * What Metal demands of a plugin's device class was measured rather than guessed
 * (docs/metal.md section 10): `MTLAddDevice` (0x181a1875c) wants an object that comes back
 * non-nil from -initWithAcceleratorPort:, conforms to MTLDevice and MTLDeviceSPI -- both
 * asserted, both fatal -- and answers -featureProfile, -maxBufferLength and
 * -supportsVertexAmplificationCount:. Four methods. Everything else in the registration
 * path, including the 64-field limits table and the 42 feature queries, _MTLDevice fills
 * in itself once -featureProfile answers.
 *
 * Three decisions in how this is written, each for a measured reason:
 *
 *   - The class is declared in SOURCE, not built with objc_allocateClassPair as the probes
 *     did. That needs the private class symbol at link time, and it is bindable: IOGPU
 *     itself imports `_OBJC_CLASS_$__MTLDevice` together with its metaclass. Only the name
 *     is declared here -- nothing about Apple's 36 ivars or their offsets, which belong to
 *     Metal 306.6.4 and are nowhere written down. Our own ivars are placed by the runtime
 *     after Apple's, which is what the non-fragile ABI is for.
 *   - `<MTLDeviceSPI>` is declared at RUNTIME, with class_addProtocol. The protocol is
 *     private and requires 337 instance methods; writing that declaration out would mean
 *     copying 337 signatures we do not implement, and the only thing the two assertions in
 *     MTLAddDevice read is conformsToProtocol:. One call says the same thing truthfully.
 *     MTLDeviceSPI adopts MTLDevice, so one declaration satisfies both.
 *   - -initWithAcceleratorPort: opens this port's OWN gpu service, `RedwoodGPU`, the way
 *     Mesa's shim does (tools/mesa/redwood-drm/redwood_drm.c: IOServiceOpen with type 0,
 *     then msm-shaped requests through IOConnectCallStructMethod). That is the road the
 *     resource layer will take, and it already carries Mesa's own dispatches today. The
 *     IOGPU road was measured shut: IOServiceOpen on our IOAcceleratorES service with
 *     Apple's type 1 answers kIOReturnUnsupported.
 *
 * The first resource is here too. A Metal buffer on this port is a GEM allocation of the
 * kernel's own gpu driver, made and mapped exactly the way Mesa's shim makes and maps one
 * (tools/mesa/redwood-drm/redwood_drm.c): kMsmGemNew (0x42) for the memory, MSM_INFO_GET_IOVA
 * through kMsmGemInfo (0x43) for the address the GPU sees, IOConnectMapMemory64 for the
 * address the processor sees, kDrmGemClose (0x09) to give it back. The kernel makes that
 * memory write-combined, with no cache of this processor between the program and what the
 * GPU reads, which is also why -didModifyRange: has nothing to do.
 *
 * Metal.framework has no `_MTLBuffer` to inherit -- only `_MTLResource`, a thin base over
 * `_MTLObjectWithLabel` -- so the buffer class is ours, as it is in Apple's own drivers
 * (`IOGPUMetalBuffer`, `AGXA11FamilyBuffer`).
 *
 * The compute path is here too, and it is where subsystem (1) finally carries something.
 * Metal hands a driver one function's LLVM module through -[_MTLFunction bitcodeData], and
 * those bytes were checked against our own AIR reader over all eleven functions of
 * AV1SW.metallib -- same lengths, same checksums (docs/metal.md 10.12). The front end that
 * reads them lives in Mesa, so the compiling and the dispatching are asked of
 * /redwood/lib/libredwoodair.dylib through the contract in tools/mesa/air/air_metal.h.
 *
 * That library is loaded with dlopen rather than linked, for a measured reason: the device
 * object must exist even when there is no GPU. The port starts the Adreno only with the
 * boot argument gpu=1, and a device that refuses to be created at all would take Metal's
 * whole discovery down with it; a device that answers its name and its limits and refuses
 * to make a pipeline is the truthful object in that case.
 *
 * Ordering is Metal's, not Gallium's: an encoder RECORDS its dispatches and the command
 * buffer runs them when it is committed. Dispatching as they are encoded would be less
 * code and would quietly reorder work an application committed in a particular order.
 *
 * Depth and stencil are here, and what that amounts to is four things: a texture of a depth
 * pixel format, an MTLDepthStencilState over the private _MTLDepthStencilState (whose SPI
 * has four methods Apple leaves answering NO, overridden here with the truth about the
 * descriptor), the render pass descriptor's depth and stencil attachments, and the
 * depth-range half of -setViewport:, which is the only thing in Metal that moves this
 * driver's quad in z at all.
 *
 * ARGUMENT BUFFERS are here, and what they are here is a RECORDER: Metal's encoder writes
 * 8-byte handles into a buffer and those are an Apple GPU's descriptors, so this driver
 * records (resource, Metal id) against (destination buffer, destination offset) instead
 * and the draw binds every member the pipeline's shaders declare. The buffer's contents
 * are never read, and an argument buffer the application did not fill through an encoder
 * is refused BY NAME (docs/air.md 8.2, and the MTLArgumentEncoder implementation at the
 * end of this file).
 *
 * BUFFER OFFSETS are honoured, which they were not: Metal's own `offset:` is recorded at
 * the encoder and judged at the draw, where the pipeline says whether an index is a
 * stream, a set or a buffer argument. A `constant` one is served at any offset -- the
 * compiler library uploads the block when the GPU cannot fetch from that offset -- and a
 * `device` one the GPU cannot fetch from is refused by name, because the shader may write
 * it and a copy would lose the writes.
 *
 * Heaps, events, multisample resolve and viewport rectangles remain unimplemented
 * (docs/metal.md 10.8). Blit currently supports buffer and matching-format 2D copies.
 *
 * Every line this file writes carries the PROCESS it was written by
 * (`redwoodmetal[progname pid]:`, see rw_print): a driver is a library, four or five
 * Metal clients are alive in one boot of this port, and a refusal nobody can attribute
 * is half a refusal.

 * per call site, so it would have suppressed twelve of those thirteen as if they were

 *
 * "Which profile the hardware deserves is a separate question, to be answered when something
 * is drawn" -- and something has now been drawn, so here is the answer so far. This number is
 * the ONLY input Apple has for what this device supports: -[_MTLDevice initGPUFamilySupport]
 * switches on it and pushes a list of MTLGPUFamily into the vector that -supportsFamily:
 * searches. Profile 0 pushes Apple1 and Common1 and nothing else.
 *
 * That is why SpringBoard cannot start. Siri's orb prewarms an MPSImageGaussianBlur, and
 * MPSDevice::GetMPSDevice is a descending ladder of -supportsFamily: from Apple8 (1008) down
 * to Apple2 (1002) which returns NULL when none answers. It never asks about Apple1 -- the
 * constant 0x3e9 is nowhere in that function -- so the one family we claim is the one family
 * it does not want, and the process aborts in MPSKernel with "Failed to get MPSDevice"
 * (docs/metal.md 10.47). Profile 1 is the lowest that pushes Apple2.
 *
 * So the profile is a boot-arg (metal_profile=N), not because it should stay configurable but
 * because the cost of each step up has to be measured rather than argued: every family claimed
 * is a promise, and some of those promises this driver cannot keep. Answering LESS is not the
 * safe direction either -- an empty family vector makes
 * +[MTLFXSpatialScalerDescriptor supportsDevice:] take this for a discrete GPU and say yes
 * unconditionally -- so there is no answer here that is safe by default, only one that is
 * measured. Apple's own A11 driver answers 5.

 * with read(coord, sample). What an application then asks for is the result in a
 * one-sample texture -- MTLStoreActionMultisampleResolve, or
 * MTLRenderPassColorAttachmentDescriptor.resolveTexture -- and the resolve is done now,
 * as a blit from the multisample attachment at the end of every draw that names one
 * (struct rwa_draw.resolve). That is what makes a yes here honest.

 * both, and two would be a second path nobody has asked to measure. Eight is declined by
 * the back end itself (a6xx/fd6_screen.cc, valid_sample_count).

/*
 * THE SLOT EVERY COMMAND BUFFER TAKES FROM THE QUEUE, AND WHY IT HAS TO BE GIVEN BACK.
 *
 * -[_MTLCommandBuffer initWithQueue:retainedReferences:synchronousDebugMode:] -- the
 * designated initialiser this driver's command buffer calls, because docs/metal.md 10.13
 * says to call the real one -- does this, at 0x181a1ea14 and on:
 *
 *     ldr  x8, [x19, _MTLCommandBuffer._queue]
 *     ldr  x0, [x8, _MTLCommandQueue._commandBufferSemaphore]
 *     mov  x1, #-1                       ; DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER
 *     bl   dispatch_semaphore_wait
 *
 * and just before it sets _MTLCommandBuffer._needsCommandBufferSemaphoreSignal to 1. The
 * semaphore is made in -[_MTLCommandQueue initWithDevice:descriptor:] (0x181a1d1fc), which
 * reads maxCommandBufferCount off the descriptor (0x181a1d268) and refuses zero; the
 * default for MTLCommandQueueDescriptor is 64. Every ivar name above is the cache's own
 * (`ipsw dyld a2s`: OBJC_IVAR_$__MTLCommandQueue._commandBufferSemaphore,
 * OBJC_IVAR_$__MTLCommandBuffer._needsCommandBufferSemaphoreSignal), not a guess.
 *
 * So each command buffer takes one of 64 slots AND OWES A SIGNAL -- that ivar is Apple's
 * own name for the debt. In Apple's driver something on the completion path pays it. This
 * driver has no completion path at all: it overrides -commit and -waitUntilCompleted and
 * never calls -enqueueCommandBuffer:, -commitCommandBuffer:wake: or any of the rest, so
 * nothing in Metal will ever pay it for us. The 65th -commandBuffer then waits for ever.
 *
 * MEASURED, not reasoned: logs/114823-run.log. A test that made 64 command buffers (one
 * per shader of an 8x8 mosaic) blocked on the 65th inside -[MTLCommandQueue commandBuffer]
 * and stayed blocked for four minutes, with a heartbeat thread proving the process alive.
 * It is not a test bug: an application makes a command buffer per frame, so this driver
 * would hang anything that drew for a couple of seconds.
 *
 * The debt is paid at -commit, and that is a choice with a reason. Metal holds the slot
 * until the buffer completes; here -commit IS the completion -- the recorded work runs
 * inside it and -waitUntilCompleted only fences -- so holding it any longer would throttle
 * an application for a wait this driver does not have. A buffer that is never committed
 * pays at -dealloc instead, which is the case Apple's flag exists for.
 *
 * Both are done through the runtime by ivar NAME, and a name that is not there is said out
 * loud rather than worked around: on an iOS whose Metal keeps this differently, the right
 * answer is to find out, not to run with a queue that silently blocks at 64.

 * the foreground and background numbers into a three-word request and hands it to the
 * kernel's own command-queue object (_IOGPUCommandQueueSetPriorityAndBackground); only if
 * the kernel accepts does it write the two ivars that -getGPUPriority reads back. So the
 * number is read by the GPU's scheduler, and the ivar is just a cache of what the scheduler
 * agreed to. The validation is worth copying exactly: anything above 5 is refused and 3 is
 * refused for a foreground queue -- "priority (%d) is not valid for foreground" is the
 * cache's own string -- and it only REPORTS, it does not stop the call, which is why
 * Apple's BOOL is the kernel's answer and not the validator's.
 *
 * This driver has one ring and one priority. Every command buffer goes to the kernel's

 * buffer is done, so they are not cosmetic.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-21 this file answered 3 for committed, 4 for scheduled and 6 for completed -- and
 * 6 is not a status at all. Under those numbers an application comparing with
 * MTLCommandBufferStatusCompleted (4) saw completion the moment -commit returned, BEFORE the GPU
 * fence of -waitUntilCompleted was paid, and after the fence it saw a number Metal does not
 * define. Error was 5 by coincidence and has not moved.
 *
 * Every boot log under logs/ was written by the old numbering and none of them is going to be
 * regenerated, so those numbers have to be DATED rather than reinterpreted. That is what the
 * banner in -initWithRedwoodQueue: below is for: it names the numbering of the log that carries
 * it, and it is printed out of these constants, so the line cannot drift from what -status
 * answers. A log without that line is older than this change, and in it "status 6" is this
 * completion, "status 4" is a buffer that was only submitted, and 2 and 3 do not occur at all.
 * That is the rule tools/air/metalcheck.py reads a log by, and the measurement that makes it
 * safe: over all 141 logs in logs/ the only statuses the test ever printed are 5 (128 times) and
 * 6 (990 times) -- never 4.
 *
 * One file more keys on the old numbers and is NOT part of this change: userland/src/
 * metal_drv_test.m compares [cmd status] with the literal 6 in five places (its lines 1200, 1526,
 * 2041, 2293, 2795) and prints the literal "status 6" in a sixth (2308). Until those move, a boot
 * with this driver has the test calling every completed buffer a failure: the sweep prints
 * "drvtest: drawall <name> status 4" with nothing after it and reads back no pixel, and the single
 * draw returns before its own readback. metalcheck.py names that shape when it sees it.

 * Ending a pass is Apple's bookkeeping, and this override used to skip it.

 * the tail of its own -endEncoding (0x181a1f4a8: `objc_release(_commandBuffer);
 * _commandBuffer = nil`). An override that does nothing leaves that ivar set, and Apple's
 * -dealloc checks it:
 *
 *   0x181a1e5f4  cbz x8, +124      ; _commandBuffer nil -> nothing to say
 *   0x181a1e610  MTLReportFailure(0, "-[_MTLCommandEncoder dealloc]", 131,
 *                                 @"Command encoder released without endEncoding")
 *
 * and MTLReportFailure here is an abort(). That is the whole of logs/214841-run.log: that
 * line 86 times and 43 aborts of backboardd, one every ten seconds, all from
 * CA::OGL::MetalContext::warmup_shaders -- which for each attachment combination it warms
 * opens a render encoder, ends it immediately, and pops the autorelease pool it made it in
 * (0x188476304, 0x188476308, then the pop whose return address is +1064). So every warmed
 * pass cost one abort. It also leaked a retain on every command buffer any encoder touched,
 * which is the quieter half of the same mistake.
 *
 * So the superclass is called, and what that runs for us is measured rather than hoped --
 * every step is Apple's own code, and the long middle of the function is skipped:
 *
 *   [_commandBuffer executeSynchronizationNotifications:1]   real; our list is empty
 *   [_commandBuffer setCurrentCommandEncoder:nil]            real; an ivar write
 *   _isProgressTrackingEncoder is 0, so no short cut through, and then
 *   [_commandBuffer errorOptions] with bit 0 clear jumps straight to the tail
 *   objc_release(_commandBuffer); _commandBuffer = nil
 *
 * Calling it twice is safe: the second time every message goes to a nil ivar and the release
 * is a release of nil. The one branch not taken is framework-assisted error tracking
 * (`errorOptions` bit 0, MTLCommandBufferErrorOptionEncoderExecutionStatus): it would build
 * an `_MTLCommandBufferEncoderInfo` and ask this encoder -getDriverUniqueID, which is a
 * one-instruction forward to -globalTraceObjectID. Nothing here turns that option on, and if
 * something ever does, that selector is where to look.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do is seal the encoder. Metal calls encoding after
 * -endEncoding undefined, and this driver would still record it; refusing that is separate
 * work and nothing has asked for it.

 * MTLArgumentEncoder, which on this driver is a RECORDER and not a writer.
 *
 * Metal's encoder writes one 8-byte handle per member into a plain buffer, and those
 * handles are an Apple GPU's descriptors: a Gallium driver, which binds by index, cannot
 * read them. It also does not need to -- the AIR frontend resolves every member of every
 * set to a binding while translating (docs/air.md 8.2) -- so each -setBuffer:atIndex:
 * here RECORDS (resource, Metal id) against (the destination buffer, the destination
 * offset) in the compiler library, and the draw binds every member the pipeline's shaders
 * declare from those records. The buffer's contents are never read, and an argument
 * buffer the application filled by any other means is REFUSED BY NAME at the draw.
 *
 * Two things are deliberate about this object:
 *
 *   - IT HOLDS NO RECORDS ITSELF. Its state is (buffer, offset), and the records live
 *     with the destination buffer in the library, because that is what Metal's own object
 *     model allows: one buffer holds several encodings at several offsets, each reused
 *     across many draws, and an application may release the encoder and go on drawing
 *     with what it encoded.
 *   - -setArgumentBuffer:offset: DOES NOT CLEAR the encoding at that offset, which is
 *     Metal's behaviour: the bytes an earlier encoding wrote there are still there, so a
 *     second encoding that sets three of five members leaves the other two as they were.
 *
 * The layout comes from the module (`air.indirect_buffer`), so `encodedLength` and
 * `alignment` are Apple's own numbers -- 8 bytes per member the set declares and 8 --
 * which matters because the application allocates its buffer from them and then encodes
 * at multiples of them.

/*
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * -[MTLFunction newArgumentEncoderWithBufferIndex:], which is a method of METAL'S OWN
 * class and is therefore installed at RUNTIME here rather than written as a category.
 *
 * Two decisions, and the first one is measured. Metal's own implementation cannot work on
 * this port:
 *
 *   -[_MTLFunction newArgumentEncoderWithBufferIndex:] (0x181aef7f4) forwards to
 *   ...reflection:binaryArchives: (0x181aef85c), which asks
 *   -[_MTLFunction reflectionWithOptions:binaryArchives:] (0x181aef458) for the
 *   function's reflection -- and that one calls -compiler, which on this port is
 *   -[_MTLDevice compiler] (0x181aac128), a two-instruction stub answering nil
 *   (docs/metal.md 10.7: everything behind Metal's own compiler is nil here). The
 *   builder then walks `[reflection arguments]`, finds a count of zero, and takes its
 *   failure path (0x181aef924):
 *
 *     MTLReportFailure(0, "-[_MTLFunction newArgumentEncoderWithBufferIndex:reflection:"
 *                      "functionReflection:]", 0x22fc,
 *                      @"bufferIndex %lu does not identify an argument buffer")
 *
 *   and returns nil.
 *
 * So the choice is not between Apple's implementation and ours; it is between nil and an
 * encoder. And what Metal was missing is what this port HAS: -[_MTLFunction bitcodeData]
 * works (docs/metal.md 10.12, checked over all eleven functions of AV1SW.metallib), and
 * the frontend reads the set's layout straight out of those bytes. Resident Evil 4 sends
 * this selector; so does any application that writes `[[id(n)]]` structs in MSL instead
 * of building MTLArgumentDescriptors.
 *
 * The second decision is HOW, and a category is the obvious way and the wrong one: a
 * category on `_MTLFunction` makes this dylib import `_OBJC_CLASS_$__MTLFunction`, and a
 * private class symbol that does not bind is a dylib that does not LOAD -- which would
 * take the whole driver down for every Metal client in the process, not just this
 * selector. The one private class symbol this driver does import,
 * `_OBJC_CLASS_$__MTLDevice`, is imported by IOGPU.framework too and has been measured
 * loading on the phone; `ipsw dyld symaddr -b` finds nothing in the cache that imports
 * _MTLFunction's, so nothing says it would bind. class_replaceMethod needs no symbol at
 * all, and it is the same move ensure_spi already makes for MTLDeviceSPI.
 *
 * What it costs, said plainly: the method is replaced for every MTLFunction in the
 * process, Apple's daemons included. Nothing is lost by that -- the implementation it
 * replaces returns nil for all of them, for the reason above -- and nothing else of
 * _MTLFunction is touched.
